# SWE-Downscaling-High-Resolution-Snow-Water-Equivalent-Mapping

## Project Description
This project develops a method for estimating high-resolution daily Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) in mountainous regionsâ€”a challenge due to complex geographical factors and sparse meteorological data. Utilizing a K-nearest neighbors algorithm with a tailored distance metric, the scripts provide downscaled SWE predictions at 500m resolution. These scripts support a broader study detailed in an associated paper, which investigates the statistical relationships between meteorological estimators and SWE.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized in a tree structure, showing folders and files essential for the project's operation. Each item listed is either a file or a directory, with directories potentially housing multiple files or subdirectories. Below is an outline of the repository's architecture:

```
/SnowWE_Estimation             # Main project folder
  |-- Demo.m                   # Script demonstrating the complete workflow
  |-- KNNSnowGeneration.m      # Function for ranking learning dates
  |-- GeneratingImages.m       # Function for generating SWE images
  /Data/                       # Contains all necessary data files
    |-- [Link to Download QueryDates.mat](#)  # Link to download QueryDates.mat
    |-- [Link to Download LearningDates.mat](#)  # Link to download LearningDates.mat
    |-- BayesResultXAtMinObjective.mat  # MAT file with algorithm weights
    |-- SWE.mat                # MAT file with Snow Water Equivalent data
    |-- SWEIndex.mat           # MAT file indexing the SWE data
    |-- RasterCal.tif          # GeoTIFF file with geospatial data
  /Output/                     # Directory for output files
    |-- ResultIndAll.mat       # Output file with ranked learning dates results
    |-- ErrorSTD.mat           # Output file detailing standard deviation of errors
    |-- ErrorMean.mat          # Output file detailing mean of errors
    |-- [Link to download OutputAll/](#)  # Link to a subdirectory with generated SWE images
```

## Using the Repository

### Downloading
- Initially, download the `/SnowWE_Estimation`, `/Data`, and `/Output` directories to your local machine or development environment. Note: Some files require accessing Google Drive links provided.

### Installation and Setup
- Ensure MATLAB is installed as the project scripts are MATLAB functions (.m files).
- Place any additional required data files into the `Data/` directory following the script dependencies.

### Executing Scripts
- Open MATLAB and navigate to the `/SnowWE_Estimation` directory.
- Execute `Demo.m` to view a demonstration of data processing and output generation. This script will call other scripts and functions sequentially.
- Explore `KNNSnowGeneration.m` and `GeneratingImages.m` to understand data ranking and image generation functionalities.

### Checking Outputs
- After script execution, examine the `Output/` and `OutputAll/` directories for generated results, including matrices and images.
- Review `ResultIndAll.mat`, `ErrorSTD.mat`, and `ErrorMean.mat` to analyze the numerical results and error assessments.
